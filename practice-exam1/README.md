## Data

We have set up a simple array of blogposts. After you've started the application you can see the blogposts in `tmp/data-set.json`. You can access the blogposts by using `req.locals.store`, all changes you make in `req.locals.store` will be saved as well.

## Task 1
1. Create a router in `routes/blogs.js`
1. Connect the router in `routes/blogs.js` to the `/blogs` URL
1. Change the `views/index.ejs` template and render all entries in the template. Make sure you at least print the title of each blog post.
1. Make the route `/` work in `routes/blogs.js` so we can see the list of blogposts when we visit the URL "/blogs"

## Task 2
1. Create a route for a detail page for each post in `routes/blogs.js` so we can visit the URL(s) "/blog/0" or "/blog/1", etc to get the blog posts by array index (0 being the first).
1. Create a `views/show.ejs` template and render them in the just created route. Make sure you output at least the blog title, the blog author and the blog intro
1. Change the template (`views/index.ejs`) from the previous task and link each blogpost in the list to the detail page so we can easily navigate from the overview to the subpage
1. *BONUS* output the blog body in a way that the HTML is not escaped.


## Task 3
1. Create a `/new` route in `routes/blogs.js` to render the form in `views/new.ejs`. Don't forget to pass the `req` object to the template.
1. Create a `/` route so the form works when you press the "Save" button in the form.
1. Validate that the data from the form cannot contain an empty title.
1. If the title is empty pass the `error` variable with an error message to the template using `req.locals`.
1. Add the data from the form to `req.locals.store` array if the input is valid (e.g. the title has been set)
1. Redirect the user to `/` after you've stored the data
